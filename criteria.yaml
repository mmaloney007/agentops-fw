# Criteria for P1 experiments (CLINC intent, HotpotQA grounded QA, synthetic tools)

structure:
  json_valid: 0.99

accuracy:
  clinc_intent_f1: 0.85
  hotpot_answer_em: 0.65
  hotpot_answer_f1: 0.75

faithfulness:
  hotpot_faithfulness: 0.80  # judge-based 0-1 normalized

stability:
  disagreement_max: 0.10

slo:
  success_at_slo: 0.75
  p95_ms: 1200

notes: |
  Apply metrics lexicographically: structure/accuracy/faithfulness must pass
  before considering stability, then SLO. Latency cannot compensate for
  truth/faithfulness regressions unless explicitly approved.
