weights:
  w_task: 1.2      # correctness first
  w_valid: 1.0     # schema adherence
  w_f1: 1.2        # field-level accuracy
  w_faith: 1.2     # truthfulness / support
  w_tool: 0.6      # correct tool arguments/selection
  w_slo: 0.1       # latency as constraint, not objective
penalties:
  l_p95: 0.02   # small latency penalty; tighten only for real-time profiles
  l_disc: 0.05  # disagreement/stability penalty
notes: |
  Prioritize accuracy + faithfulness; keep latency as a constraint. For
  latency-critical cases, increase w_slo and l_p95, but do not lower the
  accuracy/faithfulness floors below criteria.yaml.
